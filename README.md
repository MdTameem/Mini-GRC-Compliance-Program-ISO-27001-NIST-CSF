# Mini-GRC-Compliance-Program-ISO-27001-NIST-CSF
Built a beginner-friendly GRC compliance program using Microsoft Excel to simulate real-world ISO 27001 implementation.

This project demonstrates how organizations manage security risks and compliance requirements using globally accepted frameworks like ISO 27001 and NIST Cybersecurity Framework.
The entire project is built using Microsoft Excel, which is widely used by entry-level GRC analysts for documentation, risk tracking, and audit preparation.
This project is designed so that freshers, non-IT professionals, HR, and managers can easily understand the GRC workflow.

*Real-World Scenario
1.A small IT services company wants to:
2.Improve information security
3.Identify and manage security risks
4.Prepare for ISO 27001 certification
5.Track compliance using simple tools

As a GRC Analyst (Fresher), the task is to build a basic compliance and risk management system.
*Tools Used
Microsoft Excel

*Frameworks Used
ISO 27001 – For security controls and compliance tracking
NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) – For risk identification and assessment
